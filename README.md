# BlockSleuth 

BlockSleuth is a Python-based Linux tool that monitors system authentication logs to detect failed SSH login attempts. It scans `/var/log/auth.log`, identifies potential brute-force attacks based on repeated login failures from the same IP, and logs alerts with timestamps for further investigation. It is scheduled to run daily using `cron`, providing lightweight, automated log analysis to help harden your serverâ€™s security posture.
